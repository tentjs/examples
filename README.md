```bash
# Clone all examples
git clone https://github.com/tentjs/examples

# Navigate to the example you want to run
cd examples/counter

# Install dependencies and start the project
npm install

```

## 🌟 Create a new example

> **Note:** Please make sure you use the latest version of Tent, and that you keep your example relatively simple. The goal is to help others get started with Tent, so the examples should be easy to understand.

To create a new example you can use the script included in this repository.

```bash
npm run new
```

This will prompt you to enter the name of your example. After you've entered the name, the script will create a new directory with the example files.
